# QuLab - AI Career Navigator & Pathway Planner

## üöÄ Project Title and Description

This project, **"QuLab - AI Career Navigator & Pathway Planner,"** is a Streamlit-based web application designed as a lab project to explore and interact with the **AI-Readiness Score (AI-R) framework**. The AI-R framework is a parametric model that quantifies an individual's preparedness for AI-enabled careers by considering both personal capabilities (Idiosyncratic Readiness - $V^R$) and market opportunities (Systematic Opportunity - $H^R$), along with a Synergy component.

The application provides an interactive environment for users to:
*   Understand the theoretical underpinnings and components of the AI-Readiness Score.
*   Calculate their own AI-R score by adjusting various individual and market parameters.
*   Simulate the impact of different learning pathways on their projected AI-Readiness.
*   Visualize how different factors contribute to their overall career readiness in an AI-driven labor market.

This tool aims to empower individuals to make informed decisions about skill development and career transitions in the evolving landscape of AI-enabled professions.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **AI-Readiness Score Components Overview**: Detailed explanations of Idiosyncratic Readiness ($V^R$), Systematic Opportunity ($H^R$), and Synergy components, including their sub-components and underlying formulas.
*   **Interactive AI-Readiness Score Calculator**:
    *   Adjust individual attributes (AI-Fluency, Domain-Expertise, Adaptive-Capacity) through sliders and input fields.
    *   Select target occupations and adjust market parameters (e.g., job growth, wage premium) to calculate Systematic Opportunity ($H^R$).
    *   Input global parameters like the weighting of individual vs. market factors ($\alpha$) and the Synergy coefficient ($\beta$).
    *   Calculate and display current $V^R$, $H^R$, Synergy %, and the overall AI-R Score.
    *   Visualizations (pie charts, bar charts) to show component contributions to scores.
*   **Learning Pathway Simulation**:
    *   Select from predefined learning pathways.
    *   Adjust pathway completion and mastery scores to simulate their impact.
    *   Project how a pathway might change an individual's $V^R$ sub-components and the overall AI-R Score.
    *   Compare current vs. projected scores through intuitive visualizations.
*   **Synthetic Data Integration**: Utilizes pre-generated synthetic datasets for individual profiles, occupational data, learning pathways, and skill requirements, making the application fully functional for demonstration and exploration without external data sources.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.8+
*   `pip` (Python package installer)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd QuLab-AI-Career-Navigator
    ```
    *(Replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL of your repository)*

2.  **Create a virtual environment** (recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```

3.  **Activate the virtual environment**:
    *   On macOS/Linux:
        ```bash
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```
    *   On Windows:
        ```bash
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

4.  **Install dependencies**:
    Create a `requirements.txt` file in your project root with the following content:
    ```
    streamlit==1.x.x # Use a compatible version, e.g., 1.30.0
    pandas==2.x.x
    numpy==1.x.x
    plotly==5.x.x
    plotly-express==0.4.x
    ```
    Then, install them:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## üèÉ Usage

1.  **Run the Streamlit application**:
    Ensure your virtual environment is activated and you are in the project's root directory.
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
    This command will open the application in your default web browser (usually at `http://localhost:8501`).

2.  **Navigate the Application**:
    Use the sidebar to switch between the main sections:
    *   **AI-Readiness Score Components**: Provides a foundational understanding of the AI-R framework. Includes expandable sections to view the synthetic datasets used in the application.
    *   **AI-Readiness Score Calculator**: Interact with sliders and input fields to define an individual's profile and a target occupation. Click "Calculate AI-Readiness Score" to see the results and visualizations.
    *   **Pathway Simulation**: (Recommended to use after calculating a base score in the "Calculator" page). Select a learning pathway, adjust completion and mastery, and simulate its projected impact on your scores.

3.  **Explore "What-If" Scenarios**:
    *   On the "AI-Readiness Score Calculator" page, experiment with different inputs for individual skills, experience, education, and target occupations to see how your AI-R score changes.
    *   On the "Pathway Simulation" page, observe how investing in different learning pathways at varying levels of completion and mastery can boost your readiness.
